This page is a list of the tools I use. It's here for me to review every now and then (and remember). Some of these I'm passionate about, others are just boring and get the job done.

### Hardware

* MacBook Pro M1 14" - Personal laptop
* MacBook Pro M3 14" - Work laptop
* Self-build Desktop - Default machine when at home, but also gaming. This was built to scratch an itch and as an excuse to do plenty of research and spend money
* Lofree low profile mechanical keyboard
* Logitech G305 Mouse
* LG 27UL650 Monitor as primary
* Dell U2414H Monitor as secondary (portrait)
* iPhone 14
* Apple Watch Series 8

### Software

* Visual Studio Code as code editor
* WSL2 on Windows with Ubuntu and zsh
* iTerm2 on Mac
