This page lists books which have made an impression on me. 

I like to read a lot, even if I don't often have time for it. I treat books as companions. This means I like to re-read some of them, or just have them sit on the shelf and provide inspiration and encouragement, even if I haven't read them yet. Reading a book is never "done". It's ok to abandon books before finishing them, or own books you haven't read. Books are a way of life. They exist so you can learn from them, and learning isn't linear. This is why this list also contains books I havent read. I include notes about why I want to read them.
