I am Slavo. I'm an engineering leader with interests in history, politics, philosophy, music and general geekiness. I grew up witnessing how the internet transformed the world, and I benefitted a lot from that disruption. Today, I spend much of my time searching for curious and helpful things I can do with it. I work for Zopa as VP of Engineering. This blog, and all opinions expressed here are my own, and don't represent my employer. I'm a Bulgarian living in London, UK.
