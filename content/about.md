Hello! I am Slavo. Tech Liberal is my corner of the internet, where I write and share. I have a keen interest in how we can make the world better through technology. I have dedicated my career to it. While that's the main theme of what I write about, I use this space to collect every possible thought, mostly for myself. I have a keen interest in history, music, philosophy. I grew up witnessing how the internet transformed the world, and I benefitted a lot from that transformation. Today, I spend much of my time searching for curious and helpful things I can do with it.

You can find what I'm currently doing in my [Now page]()
