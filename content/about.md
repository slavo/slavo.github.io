Hello! I am Slavo. Tech Liberal is my corner of the internet, where I write and share. I have a keen interest in how we can make the world better through technology. I have dedicated my career to it. While that's the main theme of what I write about, I use this space to collect many possible thoughts, mostly for myself. I have a keen interest in history, music, philosophy. Occasionally, I will write about things I want to remember or search later, even if not useful to the wider world. As Paul Graham advised, [writing helps me think](https://paulgraham.com/writing44.html), so that's what I do here.

You can find what I'm currently doing in my [Now page]({{< ref "/now" >}}).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavoingilizov) (at least until Elon goes completely bonkers) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slavoingilizov/).
