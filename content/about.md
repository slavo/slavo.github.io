Hello! I am Slavo Ingilizov. 

Tech Liberal is my corner of the internet, where I write and share. I have a keen interest in how we can make the world better through technology. I have dedicated my career to it. While I mostly I write about that, I use this space to collect thoughts on many other themes, mostly for myself. I am interested in history, music, philosophy, entrepreneurship. Occasionally, I will write about things I want to remember or search later, even if not useful to the wider world. As Paul Graham advised, [writing helps me think](https://paulgraham.com/writing44.html), so that's what I do here. If others find it helpful, that's a great bonus.

Why Tech Liberal? That's the shortest way to describe my beliefs. Each of us identifies with something - views, values, a profession. Technology and liberalism are two of the things that make me who I am. I've been around technology and made it my calling from early age. My father was an electronics engineer and always brought things home, which I ~~broke~~ played with. I got hooked on early PC games ([Alley Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game)), [Digger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digger_(video_game)) in the [MS-DOS 2.x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS#MS-DOS_2.x) era) and things escalated from there.

I was always a liberal. I didn't know what that meant for a long time, though. It was late in my life that I discovered and adopted the term. I was heavily influenced by studying in a [liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education#:~:text=Liberal%20arts%20education%20at%20the,social%20sciences%2C%20and%20foreign%20languages.) institution (albeit with a STEM degree) which gave me the vocabulary and framework to define my beliefs. Liberalism has [allegedly peaked](https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/the-decline-of-liberalism), and is in decline. There are definitely signs of that, although I'm not sure if it's a decline of belief, or a decline of news coverage and a change of fashion. In any case, I believe in the core values of liberalism. Based on historical evidence, our society, and we as individuals, do best when we are free. Freedom is a key tenet of liberalism, and while the term is often misused, at least that part has always been clear. My definition of liberalism closely aligns with that described by Dr. Bret Devereaux in [The Philosophy of Liberty - On Liberalism](https://acoup.blog/2024/07/05/collections-the-philosophy-of-liberty-on-liberalism/) (It's a very long read).

So welcome to Tech Liberal! I hope you find something that is useful, or at least interesting.
