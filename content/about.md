I am Slavo. I'm primarily an engineering leader, but I consider myself a generalist. I have a keen interest in history, music, philosophy. I grew up witnessing how the internet transformed the world, and I benefitted a lot from that transformation. Today, I spend much of my time searching for curious and helpful things I can do with it. I work for [Zopa](https://www.zopa.com) as VP of Engineering. This blog, and all opinions expressed here are my own, and don't represent my employer. I'm a Bulgarian living in London, UK.

I have learned things over the years, mostly about growing tech teams, making them effective or how technologists can work with other stakeholders. I'll try to share them here and hopefully someone finds them useful. If not, then at least I'll have them all in one place.
