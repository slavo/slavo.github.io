I am Slavo. I'm a technology leader by profession, with interests in history, politics, philosophy, music and general geekiness. I grew up witnessing how the internet transformed the world, and I benefitted a lot from that disruption. I spend much of my time searching for curious and helpful things I can do with it. I work for Zopa as VP of Engineering, but this blog is my own and doesn't represent my employer. I'm a Bulgarian living in London, UK.
