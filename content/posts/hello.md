I had a blog before, but it's gone. I killed it several years ago. It was one I started as a student, and my first year in a professional job, so most things I wrote appeared very naive and badly written. I have been toying with the idea of starting again for years now. There are things I want to say, but I never got round to it. However, the idea of writing always comes back. It's one of those angel/devil figures at one's shoulder in children's cartoons that never goes away and has an agenda. I recently went back to reading Scott Hanselman, who is one of the most prolific bloggers I've seen, and I wanted to figure out why he does it. [Here's what he says](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/scott-hanselmans-complete-list-of-productivity-tips):

> "A lot of people say, 'Well, Scott, you're doing all this stuff. Why do you do it? Are you not sleeping?" Hanselman says. "It's because, I must dance. I can't stop. Whenever I think about stopping, I think about this little boy and how excited he is about doing what he's doing."

For me, the dancing kid is the devil on my shoulder, who keeps coming back and guilt-trips me for not writing. So if blogging is what it takes to drive him away, then so be it. Here it is.
