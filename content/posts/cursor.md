I've been working in the tech industry for 17 years now, and rarely has my mind been blown away. It was today. I tried playing with the new Cursor AI-first code editor. In about 10 minutes, I managed to create an entire application with a FastAPI backend, NextJS frontend and a SQLite database, which manages and displays data. I did all of this through chatting with a Claude 3.5 sonnet LLM, which is embedded in Cursor and used by default. I didn't write a single line of code myself.
