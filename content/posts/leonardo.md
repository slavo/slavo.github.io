"Describe the tongue of the woodpecker". This is one of the items on Leonardo Da Vinci's to-do list. We think of him as the greatest artist of all time, or a genius dabbling in engineering and cross-disciplinary research. But what actually defines him is his unsatiable curiosity. And this to-do list item exemplifies it. This was my biggest takeaway from Leonaro's biography by Walter Isaacson.
