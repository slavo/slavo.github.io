Moving from an individual contributor to a manager role is a major step in the career of many technologists. It's a step many engineers struggle with. One of the reasons for this struggle is the natural tendency to stick to what you know. Many Engineering Managers keep coding and solving technical problems, even after moving into a manager role. They are afraid that if they don't, they will lose their edge, or lose the trust they have with their team. These are valid concerns, but are they enough to justify continuing to write code as a manager? I don't think so and this post will try to explain why.
