Moving from an individual contributor to a manager role is a major step in the career of many technologists. It's a step many engineers struggle with. One of the reasons for this struggle is the natural tendency to stick to what you know. Many Engineering Managers keep coding and solving technical problems, even after moving into a manager role. I've heard multiple reasons for this. They usually fall into one of these categories:

* I don't want to lose my technical skills and I want to keep up to date
* I want to help the team transition gradually rather than stopping right away
* I need to sympathise with the problems the team have to be a good manager
* We're late and I want to help deliver this project
* No one else could solve this problem, so it has to be me
* I feel I'm not using half my skills if I don't code, so the company misses out

These sounds like logical reasons. But are they enough to justify that a manager should code?
