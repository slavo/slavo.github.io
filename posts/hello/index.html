I killed it several years ago. It was one I started as a student, so most things I wrote appeared very naive and badly written. I have been toying with the idea of starting again for years now. There are things I want to say, but I never got round to it. However, the idea of writing always comes back. It&rsquo;s one of those devil figures at one&rsquo;s shoulder in children&rsquo;s cartoons that never goes away and has an agenda. I recently went back to reading Scott Hanselman, who is one of the most prolific bloggers I&rsquo;ve seen, and I wanted to figure out why he does it. <a href=https://www.hanselman.com/blog/scott-hanselmans-complete-list-of-productivity-tips>Here&rsquo;s what he says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A lot of people say, &lsquo;Well, Scott, you&rsquo;re doing all this stuff. Why do you do it? Are you not sleeping?&rdquo; Hanselman says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because, I must dance. I can&rsquo;t stop. Whenever I think about stopping, I think about this little boy and how excited he is about doing what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Unlike Scott, I can stop, and I did for a long time. But doing that keeps the voice in my head and it doesn&rsquo;t go away. So after a few years, I&rsquo;m finally trying again. If blogging is what it takes to drive that devil figure away from my shoulder, then so be it. Here it is.</p></article></div></div></main><footer class=Footer><div class=u-wrapper><div class=u-padding>Copyright Â© Slavo Ingilizov 2023</div></div></footer></body></html>
