I killed it several years ago. It was one I started as a student, so most things I wrote appeared very naive and badly written. I have been toying with the idea of starting again for years now. There are things I want to say, but I never got round to it. However, the idea of writing always comes back. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those devil figures at one&amp;rsquo;s shoulder in children&amp;rsquo;s cartoons that never goes away and has an agenda. I recently went back to reading Scott Hanselman, who is one of the most prolific bloggers I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, and I wanted to figure out why he does it. &lt;a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/scott-hanselmans-complete-list-of-productivity-tips">Here&amp;rsquo;s what he says&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A lot of people say, &amp;lsquo;Well, Scott, you&amp;rsquo;re doing all this stuff. Why do you do it? Are you not sleeping?&amp;rdquo; Hanselman says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s because, I must dance. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop. Whenever I think about stopping, I think about this little boy and how excited he is about doing what he&amp;rsquo;s doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Unlike Scott, I can stop, and I did for a long time. But doing that keeps the voice in my head and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away. So after a few years, I&amp;rsquo;m finally trying again. If blogging is what it takes to drive that devil figure away from my shoulder, then so be it. Here it is.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
